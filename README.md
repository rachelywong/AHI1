# AHI1
3D Modelling of AHI1 Disease Protein Coding Gene

Protein modelling of disease protein coding gene AHI1 using homology modelling from SWISS-Model. The final model can be viewed and edited with PyMol. Mutations were highlighted and labelled in the model based on type (missense, nonsense, insertion/deletion, etc).
